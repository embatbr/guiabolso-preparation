# guiabolso-preparation

Collection of reviews and a mock system to study prior the beginning at GuiaBolso.


## What to do

- Create a mock database (possibly using PostgreSQL) of the GuiaBolso's. Create random data, using a structure similar to the platform's (spents divided in categories).
- Migrate the relational database to one using Apache Cassandra (or other NoSQL database).
- Extract information hidden in the database. At this stage, the Machine Learning techniques used will be defined.

It is advisable to use Python and Python-like tools and frameworks.


## Good Practices

Try to use TDD for everything.
